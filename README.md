    2️2. Highlight Key Features in Bullet Points
    
     Use 3-5 concise points that showcase what makes your product valuable.
     Focus on user benefits, not just technical details.
    
     Example:
     Key Features
         Drag-and-drop task management for easy organization
         Built-in calendar integration to track deadlines
         Real-time collaboration for team projects
         Customizable notifications & reminders
    
     Avoid:
     "Utilizes an advanced Kanban-style interface with integrated RESTful APIs for workflow optimization." (Too technical for most users!)
    3️3. Use a Tagline (Optional, but Powerful!)
    
     A short, catchy phrase that sums up your product’s benefit.
     Example:
     "Stay organized. Stay productive. Get things done with TaskMaster."
